# PDF Viewer

<a href="https://github.com/ItaloPussi/simpleProjectsJS/blob/master/pdfViewer/readme.pt.md">VersÃ£o em PortuguÃªs</a> ðŸ‘ˆ

One of the most used file types in the world is PDF. Think about that: how fun would be to create your own pdf reader?
In this project I work with this concept!

## Functionalities

    - By now, only see the default pdf;
    - Move pages and resize the document;

## Use

If you want to test the program, just clone this subdirectory and start the file```index.html``` with a live-server extension.

## Main concepts covered;
	- PDF.js module;
    - Events;
